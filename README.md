Executive Summary
NBA (National Basketball Association) is a men’s professional basketball league in North America.
It comprises of 30 teams being divided into Eastern and Western conferences. It is one of the
major sports leagues in the world in terms of popularity and the amount of money involved in
the game. Power rankings are representations of competitive strength, often directly comparable
so that the game between any two teams can be predicted.
They are used by various sports agencies, thought experts and bettors to determine the team
positions each week as the league goes on over a period of six months. From a simplistic point of
view, power rankings are what people come up with in order to organize their thoughts and
compare one team to another with limited hassle or confusion.
In this project, we plan to achieve two goals by predicting Power Rankings:
• Helping online bettors to place odds on the teams based on their stats and performances
in the previous week.
• Help sports analysts and thought experts to use our Power Rankings in order to analyze a
team’s performance over the past weeks.
Problem Significance
Power rankings are a system that analyzes the results of a sports competitions to provide ratings
for each team. Power rankings are very subjective for the most part, and it is up to the creator to
determine what factors carry the most weight when determining the order. Along with predicting
the Power Rankings, we also want to see what factors contribute most in increasing or decreasing
the ratings for a period of time.
This analysis is aimed at predicting Power Rankings of all the 30 teams based on their
performance in the past 20 weeks. We plan to use Panel Data Analysis - Fixed and Random
Effects, since this is a cross sectional data spread over different points of time. We are not
considering some factors in our analysis such as trade-offs of players between different teams
and injury of players in the ongoing games. These factors are not something that we can control
for hence we have not taken these into our analysis. We are predicting Power Rankings for
bettors to set different odds for various teams based on our model.
